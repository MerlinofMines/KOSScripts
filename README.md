#Some Awesome Resources, so I don't lose track (work in progress):

#Steering
https://www.reddit.com/r/Kos/comments/8ee7f3/steering_manager_examples/
 - how to get roll to update at the same time as pitch & yaw using the cooked steering.  Need to test this.  may be useful for our landing sequence

#True/Mean Anomaly
https://www.reddit.com/r/Kos/comments/4tm0wq/two_common_mistakes_people_make_when_calculating/ - information about converting from true anomaly to eccentric, and eccentric to mean anomaly.

#Line Endings!
Turns out it was tricky to create multi-line string text.  Turns out "char(10" can represent \n.
